This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Real Estate Website

First, run the development server:

```bash Frontend
npm run dev
``` Backend
npx convex dev

```
A modern real‑estate platform built with Next.js, Convex, TailwindCSS, and Clerk for authentication. The website allows users to browse, filter, and view real‑estate listings, and admins can manage properties easily.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
